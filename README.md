🔐 JWT Authentication Flow

Registration
When a user register his password is hashed by using bycrypt,then based on user given information data stored in database.

Login

When a user logs in, they provide credentials (email/password).

Server verifies credentials and with predefined jwt secret,jwt signature is used to give a JWT accessToken and a refreshToken.

Access Token Usage

The accessToken is stored securely (usually in memory or HttpOnly cookies).

This token is attached to authorization headers (Authorization: Bearer <token>) for protected API requests.

Refresh Token Flow

accessToken usually has a short expiry (e.g., 15 mins).

When the accessToken expires, the app automatically sends the refreshToken to /auth/refresh-token endpoint.

The server validates the refreshToken and issues a new accessToken.

The new accessToken should be used for futher request.

Logout

On logout, the refreshToken is invalidated on the server and removed from the client.

This setup ensures that the user stays authenticated securely without needing to log in frequently, and limits exposure in case of a token compromise.
